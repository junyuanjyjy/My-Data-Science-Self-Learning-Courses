# My Self Learning Journey in Data Science 

I finished my BSc (Hons) Accounting in 2017. 
In 2018 I decided to work towards becoming a Data Scientist while working full time(Due to some constraints). 

There are broadly two categories of courses I have taken up until now. 

## Programming courses
- EdX: [CS50 Introduction to Computer Science  Harvard University](https://certificates.cs50.io/dc810ca8-9ca2-4fa0-b352-e0015566caea.pdf?size=letter)
- Coursera: [Deep Learning Specialisation](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/XXQEFAAPR7SF)

## Math courses
I undertake a Maths & Econs Degree. 
- [Statistics 1](https://london.ac.uk/courses/statistics-1-st104a)
- [Statistics 2](https://london.ac.uk/courses/statistics-2-st104b)
- [Algebra](https://london.ac.uk/courses/algebra-mt1173)
- [Calculus](https://london.ac.uk/courses/calculus-mt1174)

There are a whole lot of courses I audit/cover a few parts to supplement my learning.
